     <NAME>RNA sequencing healthy Atlantic cod</NAME>
     <TITLE>RNA sequencing of the spleen / headkindey of 6 juvenile Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) individuals.</TITLE>
     <DESCRIPTION>Total RNA was isolated from the head kidney/spleen of six healthy juvenile Atlantic cod. These fish originate from the Norwegian cod breeding program and were grown out in in seawater of 3. 4 % salinity at 10 ºC, 24 hour light and fed ad libitum with commercial feed at the Aquaculture Research Station (Tromsø, Norway). The fish were reported to be healthy without any history of diseases and the use of these fish was approved by the National Animal Research authority in Norway (FOTS id 1147). The tissue was stored on RNAlater (Life Technologies) and total RNA was isolated using Trizol (Life Technologies) according to protocol but using half the amount of tissue per volume Trizol recommended by the manufacturer. Sequencing libraries were produced according to the IlluminaTruSeq protocol (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA). Illumina HiSeq2000 100 bp paired-end sequencing services were provided by the Norwegian Sequencing Centre (http://www. sequencing.uio. no).</DESCRIPTION>

     <NAME>RNAseq of healthy and vibriosis vaccinated Atlantic cod juveniles</NAME>
     <TITLE>RNAseq and de novo transcriptome assembly of healthy and vibriosis dip vaccinated Atlantic cod juveniles comprising a time-series with parallel controls on day 2, 4, 21 and 42 days post vaccination.</TITLE>
     <DESCRIPTION>RNAseq and de novo transcriptome assembly of 48 Atlantic cod juveniles. The samples comprise a time-series experiment with parallel control samples on day 2, 4, 21 and 42 post vaccination. The Atlantic cod juveniles were selected from a family suceptible towards vibrosis maintained by the Norwegian Atlantic cod breeding program. The samples are derived from a larger vaccine trial published by Mikkelsen et al, 2013 (DOI: 10.1016/j.fsi.2012.10.010). In short: An experimental dip vaccine produced by PHARMAQ AS (Norway) containing bacterin of V. anguillarum serotype O2b isolate 4299. Atlantic cod (approx. 2.5 g) were dip vaccinated by immersion for 30 seconds in diluted vaccine (1:10 in seawater), according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Controls were mock vaccinated by dipping in sea water without vaccine. Samples were sequences on Illumina HiSeq 2000 , 2 x 100 bp paired end, non-stranded. The associated transcriptome assembly consists of RNAseq reads from this vibriosis vaccine experiment and a Francisella infection experiment run in parallell (see ENA-SUBMISSION: ERA556290).</DESCRIPTION>

     <NAME>RNAseq of healthy and Francisella noatunensis infected Atlantic cod juveniles</NAME>
     <TITLE>RNAseq of 48 Atlantic cod juveniles. Time-series of a Francisella noatunensis infection with parallell controls 6hrs, 2, 4 and 7 days post intraperitonal injection</TITLE>
     <DESCRIPTION>The Francisella noatunensis subsp. noatunensis NCIMB 14265 isolate used for challenge was originally isolated from diseased Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) in Norway, and was provided by Dr. Duncan Colquhoun at the National Veterinary Institute Oslo, Norway. The fish were acclimated to 15 ºC and starved 24 h before injection. Prior to intra-peritoneal (ip) injection, the fish (approx. 25 g) were anaesthetised with Metacainum (50 mg/l, Norsk Medisinaldepot), and injected with 100 µl of either F. noatunensis (5 x 107 cfu per fish) or 0.9 % NaCl (control). Head kidney from 6 individuals was sampled at 6 hours, 2, 4 and 7 days post challenge from both the treated and untreated groups. All libraries were prepared using the TruSeq™ RNA low-throughput (LT) protocol (Illumina), non-stranded. All libraries were sequenced 100bp paired-end (PE) at the Norwegian Sequencing Centre on the Illumina HiSeq 2000</DESCRIPTION>

     <NAME>Effects of organophosphate flame retardants on Atlantic cod liver cells</NAME>
     <TITLE>Effects of organophosphate flame retardants on Atlantic cod liver cells</TITLE>
     <DESCRIPTION>Organophosphorous flame retardants (PFRs) were first reported in the late 1970, and today they account for approximately 20 % of the total use of flame retardants in Europe. PFRs are found ubiquitously in the environment, including remote areas stretching from the Arctic to the Antarctic. Generally, similar levels of PFRs is observed between Arctic and more rural areas. The toxicity of PFRs varies depending on their chemical structure. The World Health Organization have reported LC50 values for mammals and aquatic organisms with high variation from 4.2 to 180 mg/L or 707 to 4700 mg/kg body weight, depending on substance and test species. However, little is known about the toxicity and physiological effects of PFRs to fish, particularly in the Arctic species. Hence, the objective of this study is to determine the effects of PFR exposure on hepatic gene expression patterns in Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) using liver explants in vitro. Liver explants were exposed to 2-Ethylhexyl diphenyl phosphate (EHDPP), tris(2-chloroisopropyl)phosphate (TCPP), and a mixture of both EHDPP and TCPP for 0, 24 and 48 hours. Samples were analyzed for gene expresson profiling using RNAseq. RNAsequening results suggest that exposure to PFRs differentially expressed genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism. We did not observe any chemical-specific effects on gene expression patterns. However, temporal changes in gene expression were observed. Most of the differentially expressed genes (DE) in 24h exposed samples are related in xenobiotic metabolism, whereas in 48h samples DE genes belong to diverse physiological processes. Overall design: Each treatment contains three replicate biological samples (liver explants) exposed to either 24 or 48 hours. The treatments include DMSO (carrier control), TCPP and EHDPP.</DESCRIPTION>

     <NAME>Transcriptome (RNA-Seq) analysis of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) precision cut liver slices (PCLS) exposed to benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) and ethynylestradiol (EE2)</NAME>
     <TITLE>Transcriptome (RNA-Seq) analysis of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) precision cut liver slices (PCLS) exposed to benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) and ethynylestradiol (EE2)</TITLE>
     <DESCRIPTION>Purpose: The objective of this study is to use Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) PCLS culture and RNA-seq analysis to map gene expression responses to BaP and EE2 exposure in Atlantic cod. Methods: A total of 8 (3 females and 5 males) juvenile cod (G. morhua) (average body weight 498 g) were used for PCLS (n = 6-8 per group). PCLS preparation and chemical exposure in the culture was performed as previously described (Eide et al., 2014). Cod liver slices were cultured in 24-well plates in the growth medium containing DMSO vehicle (CAS No: 67-68-5), BaP (CAS No: 50-32-8) (10 or 1000 nm), EE2 (CAS No: 57-63-6) (10 or 1000 nm) or BaP and EE2 mixture (10 or 1000 nm each). After 48 hors of culture, the slices were collected and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C for RNA extraction. Results: In total, we had 47 high-quality samples, which were aligned to the published CDS of Atlantic cod (ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-90/fasta/gadus_morhua/cds/Gadus_morhua.gad) using HISAT2 v2.1.0 (Kim et al., 2015). Counts were generated from the alignments using SAMtools v1.4.1 (Li et al., 2009). Differential expression analysis was performed using edgeR v3.18.1 (McCarthy et al., 2012) between control group and each treated group using paired test, after removing the genes with all-zero counts across all samples of the two compared groups. Differentially expressed genes were defined by p-value &lt; 0.05 after adjustment using the Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing correction. Several genes were differentially expressed in the BaP and EE2 and mixture treatment groups compared to the group. Hierarchical clustering showed that signature expression profile of top differentially expressed genes in response to the single treatment was distinctly maintained also in the equimolar binary mixtures. Conclusions: Combining high-throughput RNA-seq analysis and PCLS culture in Atlantic cod, we have shown that BaP and EE2 differentially regulated many genes in the AHR and ER pathways. The results show that omics data can be generated using an efficient PCLS in vitro culture system. Overall design: The seven treatment groups are DMSO (vehicle control), 10nM BaP, 1uM BaP, 10nM EE2, 1uM EE2, 10nM Mix (BaP + EE2, 10nM each) and 1uM Mix (BaP + EE2, 1uM each). Each treatment group consists of PCLS RNA samples prepared from 6-8 fish (n = 6-8 per group). A total of 47 samples were sequenced. For each sample, 50 million 75 bp paired-end reads were generated.</DESCRIPTION>

     <TITLE>Transcriptomic analysis of Baltic cod (Gadus morhua) liver infected with Contracaecum osculatum third stage larvae indicates parasitic effects on growth and immune response</TITLE>
     <DESCRIPTION>Purpose: To investigate any association between parasite infection and physiological status of the host we performed a comparative transcriptomic analysis of liver obtained from C. osculatum infected and non-infected cod. Methods: Samples for transcriptomic analyses were collected from cod caught by local fishermen. Infected cod: Live cod (ten specimens) obtained by trawling along the Coastline of Bornholm were brought ashore (Nexø, Bornholm island, Denmark) and stocked in fish tanks (volume 8 cubic meter) supplied with running saltwater from the Baltic (salinity 8 ppt, temperature 10 °C). Non-infected cod: Live cod (ten specimens) were caught on the coastline of Zealand and stocked in similar fish tanks at the fish keeping facility (Blue Planet, Kastrup, Denmark). Total RNA was extracted using RTN350 (Sigma-Aldrich), according to the manufacturer’s instruction and subsequently, DNase treated with DNase I (Thermo Scientific, USA). Quality and integrity of the total RNA were checked on an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 total RNA Nano series II chip (Agilent, Amstelveen, Netherlands). Illumina RNAseq libraries were prepared from 500 ng total RNA using the Illumina TruSeqTM Stranded mRNA LT Sample Prep Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Illumina Inc. San Diego, CA, USA). All RNAseq libraries (150-750 bp inserts) were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2500 sequencer as 1 x 50 nucleotides single-end reads according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Image analysis and base calling were done using the Illumina pipeline. Reads were aligned to the Rainbow trout reference genome (http://www.genoscope.cns.fr/trout/data/) using TopHat (version 2.0.5) and on average 53.4% of the RNAseq reads could be mapped. The resulting files were filtered using SAMtools (version 0.1.18) to exclude secondary alignment of reads. For statistical comparison of gene expression levels between groups, aligned fragments per predicted gene were counted from SAM alignment files using the Python package HTSeq (version 0.5.3p9). To make comparisons across samples possible, these fragment counts were corrected for the total amount of sequencing performed for each sample. As a correction scalling factor, we employed library size estimates determined using the R/Bioconductor (release 2.11) package DESeq. Read counts were normalized by dividing the raw counts obtained from HTSeq by its scale factor. Correction for false positives is included in the statistical analysis of gene expression through DESeq. The cut-off for significance was set to adjusted p&lt;0.05 and at least 2-fold change. Results: A total of 47,025 unigenes were identified from cod liver, of which 2,085 (4.43%) unigenes were differentially expressed in the infected liver when compared to non-infected. Of the differentially expressed unigenes (DEGs) 1,240 unigenes were up-regulated while 796 were down-regulated. The Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis showed that 845 DEGs were highly represented in cellular process and single-organism process, cell and cell part, binding and catalytic activity. As determined by the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genomes (KEGG) Pathways analysis, 241 DEGs were involved in 753 pathways. Eighty DEGs were related to metabolic pathways including carbohydrate, lipid, and amino acid metabolism. Twenty-four regulated genes were playing a role in immune response such as complement and coagulation cascades, B-cell receptor signalling, chemokine signalling and twenty-five genes (most of which were down-regulated) were associated with growth of Baltic cod Conclusion: a transcriptomic profile of rainbow trout gills exposed to the parasitic I. multifiliis was reported for the first time. A total of 3,355 differentially expressed unigenes were identified. Of these were 1,184 unigenes (mapped to 952 genes) annotated 282 KEGG pathways and 268 unigenes were associated with 16 immune pathways. Most unigenes were related to innate immune system pathways (Chemokine signaling pathway, Platelet activation, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, and Leukocyte transendothelial migration) although a number of unigenes was related to adaptive responses (antigen processing and presentation, T and B cell receptor signaling pathway). The present study gave a far better resolution of the immune response of rainbow trout exposed to a parasitic protozoan than has ever been presented previously. The identification of a series of immune genes involved in several but important was useful for understanding of immune mechanism of the rainbow trout responding to the parasite I. multifiliis. Our results provide tools to link innate and adaptive immune elements in the process and present basic information which will be useful in the future studies related to immunoprophylaxis. Overall design: Transcriptome profiling of Baltic cod liver infected by Contracaecum osculatum was generated by Next Generation Sequencing, in 10 replicates, using Illumina HiSeq2500 sequencer.</DESCRIPTION>
