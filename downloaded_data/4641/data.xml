     <DESCRIPTION>Banana (Musa) is one of the most important crops grown in tropical and sub-tropical areas. Cavendish, the most widely grown banana cultivar, is a triploid derived from an intra-species cross. Cavendish is relatively resistant to Race 1 of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. Cubense (Foc1) which caused wide spread Panama disease during 1960s but is susceptible to Race 4 of Foc (Foc4) which has been causing epidemics in large areas of banana fields in Asia and Australia in the last decade and is threatening world banana production. The genome of the diploid species Musa acuminata (AA) which is the ancestor of a majority of cultivated banana has recently been sequenced. Availability of banana transcriptomes will be highly useful for improving banana genome annotation and assembly and for banana biological research.</DESCRIPTION>

     <TITLE>Analysis of banana transcriptome and global gene expression profiles in banana roots in response to infection by Race 1 and Race 4 of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. Cubense</TITLE>
     <DESCRIPTION>Background: Banana (Musa) is one of the most important crops grown in tropical and sub-tropical areas. Cavendish, the most widely grown banana cultivar, is a triploid derived from an intra-species cross. Cavendish is relatively resistant to Race 1 of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. Cubense (Foc1) which caused wide spread Panama disease during 1960s but is susceptible to Race 4 of Foc (Foc4) which has been causing epidemics in large areas of banana fields in Asia and Australia in the last decade and is threatening world banana production. The genome of the diploid species Musa acuminata (AA) which is the ancestor of a majority of cultivated banana has recently been sequenced. Availability of banana transcriptomes will be highly useful for improving banana genome annotation and assembly and for banana biological research. The knowledge of global gene expression patterns influenced by infection by different Foc races will help to understand the pathogenesis processes and the host responses to the infection. Results: RNA samples extracted from different organs of the Cavendish cultivar were pooled for deep sequencing using the Illumina sequencing technology. The assembled reads were aligned with the genome of M. accuminata and with sequences in the Genbank databases. The analysis led to identification of 842 genes that were not annotated by the Musa genome project. A large number of simple nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and short insertions and deletion (indels) were identified from the transcriptome data. GFP-expressing Foc1 and Foc4 was generated and used to monitor the infection process. Digital gene expression (DGE) profiling analysis was carried out to obtain transcriptome profiles influenced by infection with Foc1 and Foc4 in banana roots at 3, 27, and 51 hours post-inoculation. Both Foc1 and Foc4 were found to be able to invade banana roots and spread to root vascular tissues in the first two days following inoculation. The profiling analysis revealed that inoculation with Foc1 and Foc4 caused similar changes in the gene expression profiles in the infected banana roots. The Foc infection led to induction of many well-known defense-related genes including PATHOGENESIS-RELATED 5 (PR5), PAL, and a lignin-forming peroxidase. The WRKY40 gene, which is a negative regulator of the defense pathway in Arabidopsis, was quickly and strongly suppressed by the infection. Two genes encoding the ethylene biosynthetic enzyme ACC oxidase and several ethylene-responsive transcription factors were among strongly induced genes by both Foc1 and Foc4 Conclusions: Both Foc1 and Foc4 are able to spread into the vascular system of banana roots during the first two days of the infection process and their infection led to similar gene expression profiles in banana roots. The transcriptome profiling analysis indicates that the ethylene synthetic and signalling pathways were activated in response to the Foc infection. Overall design: Digital gene expression (DGE) profiling analysis was carried out to obtain transcriptome profiles influenced by infection with Foc1 and Foc4 in banana roots at 3, 27, and 51 hours post-inoculation. The plants whose roots were immersed in the culture medium without the pathogen (mock inoculation) were used as a control.</DESCRIPTION>

     <TITLE>1) Cold-sensitive Cavendish Banana; 2) Cold-tolerant Dajiao Plantain Transcriptome or Gene expression</TITLE>
     <DESCRIPTION>In this study, Dajiao (Musa spp. Dajiao; ABB Group) collected from subtropical region of China with high cold-tolerance was used to investigate responses to cold stress at transcriptional level. A cold-sensitive Cavendish (Musa spp. Cavendish; AAA Group) was also examined as a control. A well-established whole genome transcriptome analysis method, based on RNA-Seq was utilized to reveal the different cold tolerance between Cavendish and Dajiao. Our study provides a broad picture of the Cavendish and Dajiao cold-responsive transcriptomes, and cold-tolerance molecular mechanisms of Dajiao under cold stress.</DESCRIPTION>

     <NAME>Musa acuminata isolate:RNA | cultivar:Berangan</NAME>
     <TITLE>Musa acuminata isolate:RNA | cultivar:Berangan Transcriptome or Gene expression</TITLE>
     <DESCRIPTION>ABSTRACT: Background- Musa acuminata cv. Berangan (AAA) is a type of banana locally grown in Malaysia. These bananas are also facing a major threat from a typical soil borne fungus identified as Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense race 4 (FocR4). Its characteristics as a complex pathogen manifesting as subtypes or races are the main reasons it is difficult to control. Genome sequence availability of the double haploid Musa acuminata originating from Pahang has become very useful to analyse RNA-seq reads and also to identify the transcriptome profile of the host response. Results-High throughput sequencing was accomplished using RNA-Seq technology based on the Illumina HiSeqTm 2000 platform. Three sets of library derived from infected plants between different time points (2, 48, 96 hrs) shows over forty million reads were generated, each corresponding to coverage of > 4, 000, 000, 000 to &lt; 8,000,000,000 bases. About 0.10-66 % reads were mapped to Musa acuminata DH Pahang genome sequence. Conclusion-This study provides the statistical analysis of the sequence reads. Based on this information further analysis on gene expression patterns influenced by infection of Foc race 4 within the tested groups and time points will help in understanding the host pathogenic responses.</DESCRIPTION>

     <DESCRIPTION>Fruit ripening-related transcriptome analysis in banana. Total RNAs were isolated from two transgenic banana samples (AS1 and AS2) with one untransformed control (WT), and cDNA libraries were constructed by Illumina kit. Later the cDNA libraries were subjected to paired end sequencing by Illumina Hiseq2500 with 100 bp sequence length.</DESCRIPTION>

     <DESCRIPTION>Abscisic acid (ABA) signaling plays a crucial role in developmental and environmental adaptation processes of plants. In this study, PYL-PP2C-SnRK2 genes, the core components of the abscisic acid pathway, were identified from banana. Further transcriptomic analyses showed that banana PYL-PP2C-SnRK2 genes are involved in tissue development, fruit development and ripening, and response to abiotic stress in two cultivated varieties. This study provides new insights into the complicated transcriptional control of PYL-PP2C-SnRK2 genes in banana.</DESCRIPTION>
