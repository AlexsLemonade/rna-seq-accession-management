# rna-seq-accession-management
Scripts and data for managing the large number of RNA-Seq accessions we want to use

## How to use

Additional lists of RNA-Seq experiments should be generated by doing the following:
  1. Run a command similar to: `./fetch_new_accessions.bash human_taxon_id.txt 200_human_SRA_20190812_9606.txt`.
    You may need to change some things such as organism name, taxon id file, date, etc.
  2. Move the output file (which would be `200_human_SRA_20190812_9606.txt` after the previous command) to a directory inside the previous_accessions directory.
  3. Add it to the repo using `git add`, `git commit`, and push the changes with `git push`.
  4. You've done it! You can now upload the file to S3 and kick off a surveyor dispatcher job for it!

The scripts are configured to automatically filter accessions from the same taxon id contained in the previous_accessions directory.
How many accessions to output is not currently configured as a parameter and instead that number is hardcoded as 200 into `fetch_new_accessions.bash`.
If you'd like to paremeterize that parameter a PR would be welcomed, otherwise it's not too hard to find and replace it.
